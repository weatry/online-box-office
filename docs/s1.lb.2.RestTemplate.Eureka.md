Eureka as service registry

### Eureka
[Netflix Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) is a RESTful service that is primarily used in the AWS cloud for the purpose of discovery, load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers.
In AWS cloud, because of its inherent nature, servers come and go. Unlike the traditional load balancers which work with servers with well known IP addresses and host names, 
in AWS, load balancing requires much more sophistication in registering and de-registering servers with load balancer on the fly. 
Since AWS does not yet provide a middle tier load balancer, Eureka fills a big gap in the area of mid-tier load balancing.

**_AWS Elastic Load Balancer is a load balancing solution for edge services exposed to end-user web traffic. 
Eureka fills the need for mid-tier load balancing._** While you can theoretically put your mid-tier services behind the AWS ELB, 
in EC2 classic you expose them to the outside world and there by losing all the usefulness of the AWS security groups.

[Spring Cloud Netflix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/docs/current/reference/html/) provides Netflix OSS integrations for Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms.
Before registering your service instances, Eureka Server needs to be started.

#### Eureka Server
Eureka server is developed based on Java. It's a web application, that can be built by following [this instruction](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki/Building-Eureka-Client-and-Server).
Spring Cloud Netflix provides an easier way to run Eureka server as a Spring Boot application.
* add dependency spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
        </dependency>
```
* annotate main class with @EnableEurekaServer
```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class EurekaServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EurekaServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```
* configure Eureka server in application.yml
```yaml
server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false
    fetchRegistry: false
```
By default, every Eureka server is also a Eureka client and requires (at least one) service URL to locate a peer.
If you do not provide it, the service runs and works, but it fills your logs with a lot of noise about not being able to register with the peer.
You can disable that by setting: `eureka.client.registerWithEureka=false`

Eureka has web page in which can show the registered instances of a service:

![eureka server.png](statics/eureka%20server.png)

You can access it and view the instances: http://localhost:8761

#### Eureka Client
To integrate Eureka Client in microservices, just adding its starter:
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
        </dependency>
```
And of course, you should still use @EnableDiscoveryClient to annotate the main class.

Eureka server provides public REST API for those which can't integrate Eureka Java client library.
See [Eureka Wiki](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki/Eureka-REST-operations) for the REST API details, notes that the API listed in the wiki is V2 REST which has been discontinued.
Spring Cloud Netflix is based on Eureka V1, removed v2 among the REST API path when you try in spring.

## Try yourself
Follow the instructions to finish the tasks
### Eureka Server
1. start obo-eureka
2. access http://localhost:8761/ in web browser
3. start obo-cinema, see what changes in Eureka web page
4. access its REST API http://localhost:8761/eureka/apps and http://localhost:8761/eureka/apps/obo-cinema to understand its workflow
### Service Discovery by Eureka
1. start another instance of obo-cinema(remember change the port), check the web page of Eureka
2. start obo-schedule, PUT http://localhost:8084/obo/schedule/test-sched/status/SALE
3. check the source code of obo-cinema and obo-schedule, explain how they work together
4. stop them one by one and check Eureka web page at the same time
