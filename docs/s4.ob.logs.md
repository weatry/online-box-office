Configuration for logs

### Spring boot logging
Spring Boot uses Commons Logging for all internal logging but leaves the underlying log implementation open. 
Default configurations are provided for Java Util Logging, Log4j2, and Logback. 
In each case, loggers are pre-configured to use console output with optional file output also available.

By default, if you use the “Starters”, Logback is used for logging. 
Appropriate Logback routing is also included to ensure that dependent libraries that use Java Util Logging, Commons Logging, Log4J, or SLF4J all work correctly.

1. file output

By default, Spring Boot logs only to the console and does not write log files. 
If you want to write log files in addition to the console output, you need to set a logging.file.name or logging.file.path property.

2. file rotation

If Logback is used, it is possible to fine-tune log rotation settings using application.yml.

| Name                                                 | Description                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| logging.logback.rollingpolicy.file-name-pattern      | The filename pattern used to create log archives.                      |
| logging.logback.rollingpolicy.clean-history-on-start | If log archive cleanup should occur when the application starts.       |
| logging.logback.rollingpolicy.max-file-size          | The maximum size of log file before it is archived.                    |
| logging.logback.rollingpolicy.total-size-cap         | The maximum amount of size log archives can take before being deleted. |
| logging.logback.rollingpolicy.max-history            | The maximum number of archive log files to keep (defaults to 7).       |

3. log level

All the supported logging systems can have the logger levels set in the Spring Environment (for example, in application.properties) 
by using logging.level.<logger-name>=<level> where level is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, or OFF. The root logger can be configured by using logging.level.root.

More information about Spring boot logging can be found [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.logging).

### Log Storage
log data can be stored in disk files, but they are difficult to query. Furthermore, log files may take a big proportion of the disk capacity.
log data is typical big data, they should be stored in nosql databases. But applications should not write log data to nosql database directly, 
because it will have to establish connection with nosql database, which may lower down the performance of logging output.

The typical pattern for logging is that applications still log to local disk files, but an independent log collector will be deployed with the application.
The collector will read logs from the log files and send the data to nosql database asynchronously. 
Some well known log collectors: [filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat), [fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/download), 
[promtail](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases), [otel collector](https://opentelemetry.io/) and so on.

Some popular solution for log storage: Elasticsearch, Grafana Loki.

## Try yourself
Follow the instructions to finish the tasks.
### Spring boot logging
1. check the log configuration application.yml
2. change log level and restart services to see what happens
### (Optional) Collect logs to Loki
1. download [promtail](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/download/v2.9.1/promtail-2.9.1.x86_64.rpm) and [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/download/v2.9.1/loki-windows-amd64.exe.zip)
2. create configuration file for loki as following:
```yaml
target: all
auth_enabled: false
analytics:
  reporting_enabled: false

server:
  http_listen_port: 3100

schema_config:
  configs:
    - from: 2023-08-01
      store: boltdb-shipper
      object_store: filesystem
      schema: v11
      index:
        prefix: index_
        period: 24h
common:
  path_prefix: /loki
  replication_factor: 1
  storage:
    filesystem:
      chunks_directory: "D:\\Tools\\loki\\data"
      rules_directory: "D:\\Tools\\loki\\data"
  ring:
    kvstore:
      store: memberlist
```
3. run loki: `loki-windows-amd64.exe --config.file loki.yml`
4. configure promtail to collect logs from log files of obo:
```yaml
server:
  http_listen_port: 9080
  grpc_listen_port: 0

positions:
  filename: D:/Tools/loki/positions.yaml

clients:
  - url: http://localhost:3100/loki/api/v1/push

scrape_configs:
 - job_name: system
   pipeline_stages:
   static_configs:
   - labels:
      job: varlogs  
      host: yourhost
      __path__: D:/logs/*.log
```
5. create Loki datasource in Grafana
6. query logs in Grafana
