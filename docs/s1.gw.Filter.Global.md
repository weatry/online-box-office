Gateway filter and integrate with Eureka
### Gateway Filter
Gateway filter can intercept the requests before they reach the final target so that they can modify the incoming request or the outgoing response.
There are two kinds of gateway filter, one is scoped filter which applies to specific route only when you config it. 
The other one is global filter, they are special filters that are conditionally applied to all routes.

When a request matches a route, the filtering web handler adds all instances of GlobalFilter and all route-specific instances of GatewayFilter to a filter chain. 
This combined filter chain is sorted by the org.springframework.core.Ordered interface, which you can set by implementing the getOrder() method.

As Spring Cloud Gateway distinguishes between “pre” and “post” phases for filter logic execution, 
the filter with the highest precedence is the first in the “pre”-phase and the last in the “post”-phase.

### Global Filter
* Gateway Metrics Filter

    To enable gateway metrics, add spring-boot-starter-actuator as a project dependency. 
    Then, by default, the gateway metrics filter runs as long as the spring.cloud.gateway.metrics.enabled property is not set to false.
    These metrics are then available to be scraped from /actuator/metrics/spring.cloud.gateway.requests.
* ReactiveLoadBalancerClientFilter

    Handles lb scheme (such as lb://myservice). It uses the Spring Cloud ReactorLoadBalancer to resolve the name to an actual host and port and replaces the URI in the same attribute. 
    So it's good way to integrate with service discovery.

* Local Response Cache Filter

    This feature enables a local cache using Caffeine for all responses that meet the following criteria:
    * The request is a bodiless GET.
    * The response has one of the following status codes: HTTP 200 (OK), HTTP 206 (Partial Content), or HTTP 301 (Moved Permanently).
    * The HTTP Cache-Control header allows caching.
* Forward Routing Filter

    Handles forward scheme (such as forward:///localendpoint). It uses the Spring DispatcherHandler to handle the request.
    The path part of the request URL is overridden with the path in the forward URL.
* Netty Routing Filter

    Handles http or https schema. It uses the Netty HttpClient to make the downstream proxy request.
* Websocket Routing Filter

    Handles ws or wss schema. It uses the Spring WebSocket infrastructure to forward the websocket request downstream.
* RouteToRequestUrl Filter

    Creates new URL based off of the request URI. Example: lb:ws://service --> ws://service
* Netty Write Response Filter

  Runs after all other filters have completed and writes the proxy response back to the gateway client response.
## Try yourself
Follow the instructions to finish the tasks
### Service Discovery
1. start obo-gateway directly
2. see the exceptions in the logs
3. start obo-eureka, obo-movie, obo-id-center
4. GET http://localhost:8080/obo/movie
5. GET http://localhost:8080/obo/id/1
6. check the configuration change in application.yml, compare the difference of these two endpoints
### Metrics 
1. start obo-eureka, obo-gateway
2. GET http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/spring.cloud.gateway.requests
3. check the result
4. GET http://localhost:8080/obo/movie
5. access metrics endpoint again, compare the output
6. start obo-movie, GET http://localhost:8080/obo/movie
7. access metrics endpoint again, compare the result
